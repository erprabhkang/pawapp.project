# pawapp.project
Pawapp is committed to rescuing and rehabilitating injured animals through
emergency medical care and post-treatment support so that no animal suffers in
pain without rescue. Besides this, our NGO Locator Network enables people to
connect with animal welfare organizations nearby them, making rescues and
treatments and eventually adoptions more accessible and efficient. We bridge the
gap between those who need help and those who can provide it, towards a
compassionate world where every injured or abandoned animal gets care, hope,
and a second chance in life.
